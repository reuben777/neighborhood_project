### Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree â€“ Project 05

# Neighborhood Map Project

### Project Overview -

This is my Udacity Neighborhood map project. I didn't use my actual neighborhood because their is not many touristic stuff here. Mostly farms and wildlife.
I want to one day go to Toronto, and therefor I choose at random a few places that popped up on google maps.
