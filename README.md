# Neighborhood Map Project

### Project Overview -

<br>
This is my Udacity Neighborhood map project. I didn't use my actual neighborhood because their is not many touristic stuff here. Mostly farms and wildlife.
I do want to one day go to Torronto, and therefor I choose at random a few places that poped up on google maps.
